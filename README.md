# hello-world
This is just for the tutorial and my introduction.

Hi there!
I am just getting started on Git, eventhough i should know this by now (better late than never right?). I am striving to be agood computer engineer and no longer intimidated by my colleagues, not to mention earning more money. Right now I know the basic and simple languages of C, C++, java & python. I have taken courses and earned cerificates. I'm currently taking HTML and CSS and JavaScriptand will soon move on to Cisco. Most of all I am thankful to God who hasn't left my side despite many convincing reasons.
